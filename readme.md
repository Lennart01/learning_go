# Learning Go
This repo contains my personal learning experience with Go as part of my project work at the [University of Applied Sciences Hochschule Karlsruhe](https://www.h-ka.de). Supervised by [Prof. Dr. Martin Sulzmann (Hochschule Karlsruhe)](https://www.h-ka.de/die-hochschule-karlsruhe/organisation-personen/personen-a-z/person/martin-sulzmann)
All code can later be run by using GitHub actions and auto linting is being implemented.
